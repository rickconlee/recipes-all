# Rick's Kombucha Recipe And Bottling Instructions 

So, I've been drinking this stuff for a while, and decided that I am going to go broke if I continue to jut buy it at the store. 

So, I went ahead and watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to do this. After going down many great rabbit holes, I now have a recipe that is pretty tasts, and I have managed to work out most of the bugs. 

## Making THe First Batch 

You wont have a SCOBE yet, so you will have to make one with store-bought kombucha as your base.
I have heard a lot of sources saying that you shouldnt use the flavored stuff, but after going to _all_ the stores in my area, literally all of them are flavored. All of them. 
So, I went with the least offensive flavor which was one of the GT kombuchas. I started with a ginger flavored 'bucha. 

- 16 cups - Filtered Water. This could be from the brita, but it absolutely 100% needs to be filtered.
- 1 1/2 cups - Pure Cane Sugar 
- 12 Bags - English Breakfast Tea - Must have Caffiene
- 2 cups - Kombuck from the store 

#### Supplies

- 1x non-reactive glass jug that can hold 1 gallon or more of water.
- 1x Breathable cloth to put on top of the jug mentioned above. 
- 1x Non-reactive funnel (stainless, or one of those rubbery food funnels. Dont use plastic.).
- Some brewery sanatizer. 
- 1x thermometer.
- 1x non-reactive glass container for the "SCOBE Hotel" (Optional). [This is where you would keep SCOBE that you are not using. You will make a new one with ebery batch.).

### Instructions 

1.) Place 8 cups of filtered water in the vessel where you will be making the kombucha, place the remaining 8 cups in the pot where you will make the tea.

2.) Boil the water to 212 deg F. 

3.) Put tea bags in the the boiling water - dunk them up and down a bunch of times. This will make sure that all the tea bags get saturated. You want that water to be as black as your soul. 

4.) Remove the boiling water from the heat source. 

5.) Set a timer for 4 minutes. When the timer goes off, remove the tea bags. You dont want to make it too bitter. 4 minutes is the optimal brew time. 

6.) After you remove the tea from the heat source, palce thermometer in the tea. 

7.) Stir in the sugar. It is important to stir the sugar in now at this step because the water molecules are moving around faster and wider than they do at room temp, so it will be easier to dissolve the solute into the water/sugar solution.

8.) Wait until the tea gets down to 80 deg F. 

9.) Add the tea to the room-temp water that you poured into your brewing vessel. 

10.) Take another temp reading. This should be in the high 70's. If it is not, wait for 15-20 minutes. 

11.) Once optimal temp has been reached, add the store-bought kombucha, stirring gently. 

12.) Cover and put in dark, temperature stable place. 

13.) Wait 7 days before checking on the kombucha. THere should be a gelatnious round layer that has formed on top, and it should smell sour. 

14.) After the time has passed, check the scobe, make sure there is no mold or other growths on top. If there is any green, blue or black, toss it and start over. 


## Flavor and Bottle 

1.) Grab some blueberries, raspberries or whatever you want to flavor the 'bucha with. 

2.) put in enough to cover the bottom of the bottle. 

3.) Secure a lit on top of the bottle(s) that you are pouring the kombucka into. 

4.) Set aside 1 cup of your kombucha and put it in your scobe hotel. Place the scobe from your batch in with this liquid. You can store it like this for up to a few weeks before you need to refrigerate it. 

4.) Let the bottles sit for 5 days. 

5.) After 5 days, place bottles in refrigerator. 


## Existing Scobe Directions 

The instructions are similar in most respects to the recipe where you start with no SCOBE. 

** The only difference betewwn the recipes: ** 
- 1 cup of Kombucha (instead of the 2 that are required to create the scobe) 

Enjoy....
