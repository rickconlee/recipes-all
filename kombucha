# Rick's Kombucha Recipe And Bottling Instructions 

So, I've been drinking this stuff for a while, and decided that I am going to go broke if I continue to jut buy it at the store. 

So, I went ahead and watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to do this. After going down many great rabbit holes, I now have a recipe that is pretty tasts, and I have managed to work out most of the bugs. 

## Making THe First Batch 

You wont have a SCOBE yet, so you will have to make one with store-bought kombucha as your base.
I have heard a lot of sources saying that you shouldnt use the flavored stuff, but after going to _all_ the stores in my area, literally all of them are flavored. All of them. 
So, I went with the least offensive flavor which was one of the GT kombuchas. I started with a ginger flavored 'bucha. 

- 16 cups - Filtered Water. This could be from the brita, but it absolutely 100% needs to be filtered.
- 1 1/2 cups - Pure Cane Sugar 
- 12 Bags - English Breakfast Tea - Must have Caffiene
- 2 cups - Kombuck from the store 

#### Supplies

- 1x non-reactive glass jug that can hold 1 gallon or more of water.
- 1x Breathable cloth to put on top of the jug mentioned above. 
- 1x Non-reactive funnel (stainless, or one of those rubbery food funnels. Dont use plastic.) 
- Some sanatizer 
- 1x non-reactive glass container for the "SCOBE Hotel" (Optional)

### Instructions 

1.) Boil the water to 212 deg F. 
2.) Put tea bags in the water - dunk them up and down a bunch of times. This will make sure that all the tea bags get saturated. You want that water to be as black as your soul. 
3.)
