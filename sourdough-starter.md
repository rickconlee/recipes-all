# Rick's Sourdough Starter Recipe

These instructions are based on 2 use cases. Use case 1 is that you have whole wheat flour to get it started. That might not be possible in some circumstances, so I also have a method for doing this with all purpose flour and bread yeast. 
I know that is sort of against the whole idea of making sourdough, but time is not everyone's friend. 

## Method 1 - With WHole WHeat Flour 

** To create the sourdough starter: **

- 60 g (1/2 cup) whole wheat flour
- 60 g (1/4 cup) water

To feed the sourdough starter each day (Day 3-7):

- 60 g (1/2 cup) unbleached all purpose flour or bread flour
- 60 g (1/4 cup) water

If you're not going to use the started for a while, feed it and put it in the refrigerator to slow down the yeast colonies. You can to to feeding it once a week at this point. 

## Method 2 - With Just All Purpose Flour 

** To create the sourdough starter: **

- 113 g (1 cup) unbleached all purpose flour
- 113 g (1/2 cup) water
- 1/4 tsp of active yeast from the store

To feed the sourdough starter each day (Day 3-7):

- 113 g (1 cup) unbleached all purpose flour
- 113 g (1/2 cup) water

You should have a usable sourdough after 2 feedings.
